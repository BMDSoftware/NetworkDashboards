Network Dashboards is a Django application that allows to upload and manage data of the OMOP CDM databases so that this data can then be presented in charts and dashboards, allowing to analyze and compare databases. To create these charts and dashboards we make use of [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), a modern data exploration and visualization platform.
